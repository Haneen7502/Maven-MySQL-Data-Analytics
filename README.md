# Maven MySQL Data Analytics Course  

MySQL is a powerful tool for managing and analyzing relational databases, essential for any analyst or BI professional.  

In this course, I took on the role of a business owner who acquired **Maven Movies**, a brick-and-mortar DVD rental shop. Using only a MySQL database, I explored inventory, staff, and customer behavior through hands-on data analysis.  

The course covered:  
- SQL fundamentals: selecting, filtering, sorting, and grouping data  
- Key database concepts and normalization  
- Complex queries using joins, subqueries, and window functions  
- Practical case studies and real-world business insights  

This repository contains my assignments and projects, applying MySQL to analyze and derive insights from structured data.
